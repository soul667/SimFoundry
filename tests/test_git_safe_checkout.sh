# Behaviour tests for git_safe_checkout_detached against real throwaway repos.
#
# The bug these cover: the guard used to ask "does HEAD have commits the pin lacks?", which is
# true of every freshly cloned dependency (a pin is older than the remote's default branch by
# construction). Every clean clone was therefore skipped, leaving the install on the wrong
# revision and failing ~40 minutes later with an unrelated ImportError.
#
# Usage: bash tests/test_git_safe_checkout.sh [path/to/git_safe.sh]
